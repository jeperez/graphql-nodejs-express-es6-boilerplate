GraphQL + NodeJS + Express + ES6 Boilerplate
======================================
The intention of this project is to demonstrate a basic NodeJS app with a GraphQL endpoint.

If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, it's best to follow [these instructions](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/install-nodejs-ubuntu-14-04) for installing nodejs.
 
This project was created on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 15.04 (64-bit) with nodejs version 4.2.1, npm version 2.14.7 and git version 2.1.4. With that configuration, the following command should work without any issues. No other operating systems or configurations have been tested.
```
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) to open the [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) in-browser editor.

On the left side, enter 
```json
{
    Hello
}
```

Press the play button.

If your app is working correctly, you should see the following response on the right side:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "hello": "world"
    }
}
```

This is what you should see in your browser:
